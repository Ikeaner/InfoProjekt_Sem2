# ludo

Ludo, or "Mensch Ã„rger Dich Nicht", was a student project for the second semester module "Computer Sciences II / Informatik II" of the Bachelor degree program "Visual Computing and Design / Computervisualistik und Design" at the HSHL (Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt).

It is a simple game programmed in Java, mirroring the basic ruleset of the popular board game Ludo. It is playable with 4 people passing the mouse to each other. The UI was achieved through JavaFX.
